# Necsus

[![Build](https://github.com/Nycto/Necsus/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nycto/Necsus/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A "disappearing" ECS (entity component system) library for Nim. Necsus uses Nim macros to generate code for creating and executing an ECS world. Components are just regular objects, systems are regular procs, and everything related to entities is handled for you.
